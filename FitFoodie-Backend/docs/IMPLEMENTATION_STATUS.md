## Current Limitations

1. **Authentication**: Basic JWT authentication is implemented, but advanced features like refresh tokens, password reset, and email verification are not yet available.

2. **Data Validation**: Basic validation is in place, but more comprehensive validation is needed for all endpoints.

3. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented, but more detailed error messages and logging are needed.

4. **Testing**: Limited test coverage, more comprehensive testing is required.

5. **Documentation**: API documentation is in progress but not complete.

6. **Performance**: No performance optimizations have been implemented yet.

7. **Security**: Basic security measures are in place, but a comprehensive security review is needed.

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for development are:

1. Complete the core user management features
2. Finish implementing the meal management endpoints
3. Implement the influencer profile features
4. Add comprehensive testing for existing endpoints
5. Improve error handling and validation
6. Enhance API documentation

## Conclusion

The FitFoodie Backend is making good progress but is still in the early stages of development. The core infrastructure is in place, and basic functionality is being implemented. Many features are planned for future development phases.
