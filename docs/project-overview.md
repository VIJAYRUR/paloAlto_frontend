# FitFoodie Project Overview

## 📱 Project Vision

FitFoodie is designed to be a fitness-focused social platform that bridges the gap between fitness influencers and users seeking health and fitness guidance. The app combines elements of social media, e-commerce, and fitness tracking to create a comprehensive fitness ecosystem.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

FitFoodie follows a client-server architecture:

- **Mobile App (Client)**: React Native application that provides the user interface and experience
- **Backend API (Server)**: Flask-based REST API that handles business logic and data persistence
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data, content, and relationships
