# GitHub Preparation Guide

This document provides instructions for preparing the FitFoodie project for GitHub.

## Before Pushing to GitHub

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Ensure all documentation is up-to-date
   - Check for any sensitive information that should not be committed

2. **Clean Up Code**
   - Remove any debug code or console.log statements
   - Ensure code follows the project's style guidelines
   - Fix any known bugs or issues

3. **Test the Application**
   - Run the application locally to ensure it works as expected
   - Test on both iOS and Android if possible
   - Verify that all main features are working

4. **Check .gitignore**
   - Ensure the .gitignore file is properly configured
   - Verify that no sensitive files will be committed

## Creating a GitHub Repository

1. **Create a New Repository**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository
   - Choose a clear, descriptive name (e.g., "FitFoodie-App")
   - Add a short description
   - Initialize with a README if the repository is empty

2. **Set Up Repository Settings**
   - Configure branch protection rules for the main branch
   - Set up issue templates and pull request templates
   - Configure GitHub Actions if needed

## Pushing the Code

1. **Initialize Git (if not already done)**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add the Remote Repository**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/FitFoodie-App.git
   ```

3. **Add and Commit Files**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## After Pushing to GitHub

1. **Set Up GitHub Pages (Optional)**
   - Configure GitHub Pages to host documentation
   - Set the source to the docs folder

2. **Create Project Board**
   - Set up a project board for tracking tasks
   - Add columns for To Do, In Progress, and Done
   - Move tasks from FUTURE_TASKS.md to the project board

3. **Add Collaborators**
   - Invite team members as collaborators
   - Assign roles and permissions

4. **Set Up Branch Protection**
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Restrict who can push to the main branch

## Best Practices for Collaboration

1. **Branching Strategy**
   - Use feature branches for new features
   - Use bugfix branches for bug fixes
   - Use release branches for releases

2. **Commit Messages**
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Use present tense (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Reference issue numbers when applicable

3. **Pull Requests**
   - Create detailed pull request descriptions
   - Link to relevant issues
   - Assign reviewers
   - Use labels to categorize pull requests

4. **Code Reviews**
   - Be thorough but respectful
   - Focus on code quality and functionality
   - Provide constructive feedback

5. **Issue Tracking**
   - Create detailed issue descriptions
   - Use labels to categorize issues
   - Assign issues to team members
   - Set milestones for tracking progress

## GitHub Actions (Optional)

Consider setting up GitHub Actions for:

1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run tests on pull requests
   - Lint code for style issues
   - Build the application

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environments
   - Deploy to production

3. **Documentation**
   - Generate and publish documentation

## Security Considerations

1. **Secrets Management**
   - Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
   - Never commit API keys, passwords, or tokens

2. **Dependency Scanning**
   - Set up Dependabot for security updates
   - Regularly update dependencies

3. **Code Scanning**
   - Enable GitHub Code Scanning
   - Address security vulnerabilities promptly
